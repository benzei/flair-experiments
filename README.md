# `flair-experiments`

This repository is part of my NLP research with
[`flair`](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair), a state-of-the-art NLP
framework from [Zalando Research](https://research.zalando.com/).

This repository will include models for various NLP benchmarks, such as
GermEval 2018. It will be updated frequently. So please star or follow this
repository ;)

# GermEval 2018

## Task 1

The first task of GermEval 2018 is to decide whether a tweet includes a) some
form of offensive language or b) or not.

All details for training a model with `flair` and achieving state-of-the-art
results are located in the [GermEval 2018](germeval-2018/README.md) readme.

The winning system for task 1 achieved a F-Score of 76.77. The currently best
model trained with `flair` achieves a F-Score of **87.04** (+10.24).
